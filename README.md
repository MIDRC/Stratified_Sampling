# Sequestration methodology through stratified sampling

Problem Definition: Data used in the development and evaluation of AI models play a significant role in the robustness and generalizability of the model performance. To enable independent evaluation of many algorithms using data from MIDRC, a sequestered commons was created using a developed method of multi-dimensional stratified sampling.  The sequestered commons is restricted from public download access but will be used for the formal evaluation of finalized algorithms. To draw from the commons an independent sample for performance evaluation, a method of task-based distribution sampling by optimized quota sampling was also developed and will be published separately.
